## Challenges
* **Servo Motors Not Spinning 360 Degrees:** Kellan raised this point in critique, so we had to adjust our original sketches/initial prototypes to accept that our servo motor wouldn't be able to spin a full 360 degrees. 
	One of the first things we tried to do was adjust the servo motor itself so that it would rotate the full 360. While we found a great youtube video as a guide, we couldn't find a screwdriver small enough to take the screw off the servo motor. 
	We then tried to experiment with gear ratios. We weren't able to make those work either, so we ultimately decided that it would be simpler to limit our expectations of what the model could demonstrate. 
* **Trouble Finding Pulleys:** At first, we wanted to buy two little pulleys for the diorama, because we thought that they would be more reliable. However, we went to both an art supply store and a hardware store, and couldn't find what we were looking for. 
	We finally decided to just make our own by stacking chipboard, which worked out for the better because it meant that our pulleys were lighter and therefore put less pressure on the servo motor. 
* **Trouble Understanding How Model Would Work:** There were so many moments in the course of this project where we just struggled to figure out what would be moving and spinning with the servo motor and what would be stationary. 
	More in-depth diagrams could have helped a little, but ultimately we just needed to make models and play with stuff to get a better understanding of how the model would finally look. 
* **Problems Attaching Diorama to Servo Motor:** 
* Measuring Correctly 

## Future Work Ideas
[Include information about how we would stop the sun from spinning, use a 360 degree servo motor]
